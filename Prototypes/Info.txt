Backend Project was an early iteration of the RestApi that I used to modify and debug
	before rolling it onto our running servers

ProtoType(StaticFrontEnd) is the file full of my inital web site stuff. Static meant
	it wouldn't take any input or give output. It didn't change at all unless css
 	and js changed its styling.

Testing -LocallyStoredStuff is a directory of two Django Project copied from a 
	raspberry pi. These served the same purposes as the Backend Project Dir.

	I deleted a virtual environment directory for the iteration with accounts
