These are all the back ups and work spaces I used when we developed MockDiscord. 
I was always paranoid something would break or need additional tweaking in only a 
moments notice and I was right. 

The Backend Directory is the directory and code that
	david commited to GitHub and was supposed to act as a blue print. It might not
	be the same as it originally was, but it should embody everything first given.

The CompletedSoftware folder containes the Final Versions of the WebServers; both 
	the frontend and backend.

The Prototypes folder has the initial software we worked on and sprinted to create
	in our first two weeks.

Throughout the Djongo projects(that's what they're technically called) there are
	additional text files that hold important info vital for easy installation
	and deployment. 

If you want to deploy and interact with the DjangoPrjects yourself, I recomend
	creating a virtual environment  Django Project and just overwrite whats 
	in it with what we have. WARNING!!!!!! THIS ALL MIGHT BE OUTDATED, BE 
	MINDFUL WHEN WORKING WITH ALL OF THIS.
