The zipped images are Projects copied from the final servers and preserved-
	ready to be copied to another linux machine with little modification needed.

I kept a backup of these, and they came in clutch the 30 minutes before the 
	presentation, when the sd cards in the raspberry pis got corrupted. 
	I remember stressing out and rushing to reflash and copy the pis and get them
	back up and running.
